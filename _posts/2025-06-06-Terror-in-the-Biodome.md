This Screamsheet is a bit of an experiment, a test run at doing dungeon crawls in Cyberpunk Red. I feel it worked when I ran it but of course this nicely formatted version has gone through some changes. The biggest change was writing in the OSR style where each room is a short description with bolded words exploded out into dot points. It feels like the most succinct way to get across this kind of info and honestly should be used in CPR's official material. If you manage to run this please leave a comment and let me know how you found it.

Also due to R Talsorian's content policy[^rt-policy] I can't put this on [itch.io](https://itch.io) and I didn't bother with layout. I want to hack this into a CY_Borg module, because that game rocks and I can take the time to make it pretty and sell it. There will be differences due to the Simulated Environment Testing area but that's future me's problem, the asshole.

    As you can see very explicit and without an exception for making it free.

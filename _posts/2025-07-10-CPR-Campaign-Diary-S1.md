I want to be more intentional with my note-taking and recall of the sessions I run. Now is the best time to start this as my biggest table is starting a new campaign, so I am now keeping a campaign diary. Expect these weekly if I can manage. If they're not weekly and you are enjoying this, hunt me down and demand answers.

Module ðŸ“–
: The Jacket[^jacket]

## The Setup

The year is 2077. Our crew run a failing net-cafÃ© (so they can make playing Elflines Online[^elo] their job), so now they are edge-running on the side. Introducing our crew

- **Nebulous** the Netrunner
- **Robin** the Fixer
- **Zomb13** the Tech
- **Oswald** the Medtech
- and finally **Hatsune Miku**[^oo-ee-oo] (yes really) the Rockerboy

This is their net-cafÃ©, the Nethole

![Fixer Dakota Smith, as shown in Cyberpunk 2077](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/cyberpunk/images/0/07/Char_Profile_Dakota.png){: .w-25 .right}
Robin has been in contact with [Dakota Smith](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Dakota_Smith), a fellow fixer in the Badlands, and she has a job for the crew. They're to head to Honest Stan's Self-Storage on the outskirts of Night City, to meet a *cowboy*. So the staff of the Nethole pile into their beat-up formerly-white van with cafÃ© regular Oswald at the wheel, while arguing about what they can do about cleaning the van. When they arrive at the storage place, there are 2 cars there already; a black and tan 4WD, and a [REO Meatwagon](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/REO_Meatwagon) ambulance. They also hear gunfire.

## Contact!!

When they get to where they are supposed to meet their contact, they see him under fire by a crew of 5 Meatwagon paramedics. The crew intervenes and Oswald blows one of them away with his heavy pistol. Nebulous got a taste of quick hacking and cut one of the gonks with her monowire whip. After the rest of the crew chipped away at the others, Zomb13 knocked 2 of them out with his stun pistol. As the last one fled, Miku turned him into a fan ending the fight.

![Falco behind the wheel](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/cyberpunk/images/6/6d/Falco_Infobox_CPEDGE.jpg){: .w-25 .left}
Their contact turns out to be [Falco](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Falco) (not the bird from Star Fox). His storage locker has been robbed by a teen with wild blue and red hair, and an old motorcycle. The thief managed to get away with 3 gun and a hi-vis REO Meatwagon jacket defaced with a stylised "ER". These items aren't inherently rare, but hold sentimental value to Falco. Nethole Inc agrees to a price of 500eb per person per item recovered with a flat 1000eb bonus if they get all 4. 

Looting the bodies of the both unconscious and dead gonks yields 4 heavy pistols with power rebuilds, keys to the ambulance, and a datashard. The crew takes the pistols and tries to take the ambulance, but Falco insists on keeping it to repay Dakota. The datashard contains access to the GPS data of the jacket. While it was worn by its original owner, David Martinez, the tracker was broken but now it seems to be sending intermittent pings. The Meatwagon guys must have been here to collect the biomonitor data from the jacket (all REO Meatwagon jackets have a biomonitor so that the Corp can sell the data as an additional revenue stream).

## The First Ping

As the crew inspects this data shard, the jacket gives another ping at Tom's Diner. The crew hot foots it over, and thanks to Oswald's fancy driving they miss most of Night City's awful traffic. They arrive to a bit of a scene, skid marks on the road and blood stains on the door. In the diner Nebulous sees an old friend at the counter, the chipper and bubbly Liv. Liv tells the crew that a kid with blue and red hair just stole a car from a couple of guys out front. When 2 guys in sharp suits ran up, clearly chasing the kid, they executed the car's owners.

Inspecting the surrounding area they find a bike matching the one Falco mentioned being stripped by scavver kids. Miku causes them to scatter in an attempt to interrogate them, managing to corner one. The kid insists they know nothing, so Zomb13 inspects the bike. It clearly belongs to the [Valentinos](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Valentinos), so they decide to head to [El Coyote Cojo](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/El_Coyote_Cojo) to get info from the one and only [Jackie Welles](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Jackie_Welles).

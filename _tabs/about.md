I'm an engineer and a forever GM who has ran many a system to find the right fit. Currently that fit is Cyberpunk Red and DCC RPG but I often bounce between a few OSR systems as well (Mothership has particularly taken my fancy).

This blog is going to be my dumping ground for TTRPG stuff. Somewhere to put my homebrew, theories, and tips. Basically anything that I bother to put to *digital* paper as a form of practice. Honing my craft like I don't run every game half in the bag (which is true because I sometimes run games before noon).
